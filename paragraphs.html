If you just put all the content in an HTML file with no markup, it just ends with up as one big blob on the website.The browser assumes it's all one string of text. 

We can try yo create separate paragraphs by leaviong a bunch of space in our HTML file, but that space doesn't count. The browser ignores it. All these words simply add up to a bunch of words in a row.

The browser doesn't know wtat this is, because we  haven't used any HTML yet to tell it what this is.
